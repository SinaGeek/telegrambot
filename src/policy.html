			<h1>Privacy Policy for GD Uploader</h1>
			<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 9, 2025</p>

			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use GD Uploader ("the Service") to interact with Google Drive.
				Our priority is your privacy.
			</p>

			<h2>2. Information We Use</h2>
			<p>
				To provide our service, we require access to certain information from your Google Account. We only request the minimum permissions
				necessary:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Google Account Email and Profile:</strong> We use your basic profile information (email and name) to identify your account
					within our service.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Permission to Upload Files (`drive.file` scope):</strong> Our service's core function is to upload files to your Google
					Drive. We request permission to create new files. We do not have permission to view, edit, or delete any of your existing files.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
			<p>
				Your information is used solely to provide and improve the Service. We use the access token provided by Google to upload files you
				send to our Telegram bot directly into your Google Drive. We do not store, share, or sell any of your personal data or the content
				of your files.
			</p>
			<p>
				The application's use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the
				<a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited-use-requirements" target="_blank"
					>Google API Services User Data Policy</a
				>, including the Limited Use requirements.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
			<p>
				We securely store the refresh token provided by Google to maintain the connection between your account and our service, so you do
				not have to re-authenticate repeatedly. This token is stored in an encrypted format.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
